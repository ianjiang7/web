 <h2>What is cereal and milk</h2> <!--used to create heading 2-->
 <p>Cereal and milk is most commonly a breakfast food that consists of a bowl of milk mixed with cereal. 
 <br>Cereal comes in all shapes and sizes and can be found in your local supermarket. 
 <br>It serves as a common breakfast item because of its calcium found in the milk and the high 
 <br>amounts of fiber and protein found in the cereal, if choosen correctly. It is also extremely convenient during busy mornings.
 <br>Below is a wikipedia article if you want to read more information on cereal:</p> <!--used to create a paragraph -->

<h2>History behind cereal and milk</h2>
<p>During the 1800s, many people developed dyspepsia, or indigestion. It was thought that large breakfasts were the cause of this malady.
<br>People believed breakfast should be lighter and more easily digestible. In the 1870s, James Caleb Jackson, the inventer of the graham cracker, began to sell "granula."
<br>It was graham flour that was baked, crumbled and baked again. They were hearty and filling but it was extremely dry and tough. 
<br>To counter this, Jackson's mother, Lucretia, stated that granula had to be soaked in milk or warm water.
<br>When John Harvey Kellogg copied Jackson's recipe, cereal began to take off. It soon grew in popularity and cereal became softer and softer but the habit of soaking it in milk remained.
<br>Below is the homepage for John Harvery Kellogg's company, Kellogg's. There you can see the variety of cereals and other food items they produce.</p>

<h2>My Personal Recommendations</h2>
<p>With so many options to choose from, it could be difficult choosing which cereal to eat.
<br>For an everyday, healthy cereal, I recommend Cheerios. They are high in fiber, cholesterol free, and low in sugar, perfect to start the day.
<br>If you don't eat cereal on a daily basis and prefer something sweeter, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Honey Nut Cheerios are good options. Be wary however, they do contain a lot more sugar.
<br>Below is a list of many different types of cereal so you can see the wide assortment of cereals to pick from. They vary in brand, taste, and color:</p>
